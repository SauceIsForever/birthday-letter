                <p class="letter-text">
                    I want to start off by saying that I love you from the bottom of my heart. You are beautiful in every way and you have grown to be such an amazing wife, mother and friend. It's kinda crazy when I think about it but we've known each other for 10 years! Throughout that time, I've seen the Lord transform you into a powerful woman and I want to say that I am honored to be your husband. As I watch you pray, seek the Lord and transform the lives of people around you, I am always inspired and asking God how you managed to do it. Your presence is so strong, your voice brings so much clarity and your prayers manifest the very presence of God. One thing I ask is keep being who God called you to be.
                </p>

                <p class="letter-text">
                    Never give up on the dreams that God has placed inside of you and keep going hard for Jesus every day. You are truly a blueprint for what it means to be a submitted vessel and I love that I get to see God move through you every day. I'm so proud of you and I pray you enjoy this day.
                </p>
